# CharacterAI Discord Bot
Simple integration with https://beta.character.ai service which you can use to add any character on your Discord server.

(The service is currently in beta test state, and it does not have any public API documentation. In this regard, I could not find any convenient way to log into account, aside from clumsy one described below, and I also cannot guarantee that this bot will not stop working in any moment CharacterAI's developers will make another update :P)
Also, I have to note that I'm very-very new to .NET and C#, so my code can be a little awful. Whole thing was made just for fun and with self-educational intentions.
> **ðŸ™„ Well, it happened way faster than I thought. Currently, integration doesn't work anymore. Not fully sure, but seems like it's the same problem as here https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT/issues/261**

##  How to set up
1. Create a new Discord application with bot (you can easily find all guides on the internet, so I won't focus on this part here).
2. Get your bot token and place it in Precompiled/_YOUR_OS_/Config.json file.
3. Create character.ai account if you don't have one.
4. Sign in and open a chat with a character you want to add on your server.
5. In adress bar locate and copy character's id (it's right after '/chat?char=...'), place it in Precompiled/_YOUR_OS_/Config.json file.
6. Open DevTools (<Ctrl+Shift+J> in Chrome) and go to "Fetch/XHR" section.
7. Reload page (DevTools should remain open).
8. Now you should see a list of requests. Locate "auth0/" and open it's response.

9. What you must see is a string that looks like '{"key":"81a8d269da126081a5f4..."}', that's your accout auth token.
10. Copy it's value and place in Precompiled/_YOUR_OS_/Config.json file.
## Launching bot:

1. Go to Precompiled/win-x64 folder
2. Launch CharacterAI_Discord_Bot.exe

Linux:
1. Go to Precompiled/linux-x64 folder
2. Execute "chmod 777 ./CharacterAI_Discord_Bot"
